===============================

## Register Summary

This appendix contains detailed descriptions for all the registers within the Epiphany core architecture. Complete 32 bit addresses are constructed by combining the local 20 bit addresses shown in the tables with the MSB aligned 12 bit core ID.

## Alphabetical List of Registers

## COREID (0xF0704)

The row-column coordinate of the processor nodes is contained in the read-only COREID register, which is accessible by software using the “MOVFS RN, COREID” instruction. The COREID register facilitates writing code that is independent of processor nodes and that can be easily mapped to any node within the Epiphany architecture.

In the case of double-word data transfers, DMAxAUTO0 receives the lower 32 bits and DMAxAUTO1 receives the upper 32 bits.

## DMAxCOUNT (0xF0508/0xF0528)

This register is used to set up the number of transactions in the inner and outer loops of the DMA transaction. The upper 16 bits specify the outer loop of the DMA transfer and the and lower 16 bits of the register specify the number of inner loops. The outer and inner loops must be set to a value of one or greater. The DMA block transfer is complete when the DMACOUNT register reaches zero. The inner count value is cleared to the initial count every time the outer loop is decremented.

|[31:16]| OUTER_COUNT| Number of outer loop iterations remaining (“2D”)| 

----

## DMAxDSTADDR (0xF0510/0xF0530)

This register contains the 32-bit address of the transaction currently being transferred. The address can be a local address (bits [31:20] all zero) or a global address. The register gets loaded when the descriptor is fetched from memory and is updated at the completion of every transaction. The updated address is equal to the old destination address added with the value in the destination field in the stride register.

## DMAxSRCADDR (0xF050C/0xF052C)

The register gets loaded when the descriptor is fetched from memory and is updated at the completion of every transaction. The updated address is equal to the old source address added with the value in the destination field in the stride register.

## DMAxSTRIDE (0xF0504/0xF0524)

The register contains two signed 16-bit values specifying the stride, in bytes, used to update the source and destination address register after a completed transaction. The lower 16 bits specify source address register update stride and the upper 16 bits specify the destination address stride. At the end of an inner-loop turn, this register is loaded with the outer-loop stride values to make address adjustments of the source and destination addresses before continuing with the next inner loop of data transfer. Before the next inner loop starts, the stride register is reloaded with the inner-loop stride values. The stride values are specified in bytes and should match the type of transfers being done. All DMA transactions must be aligned appropriately in memory.

## ILAT (0xF0428)

The ILAT register records all interrupt events. All events are positive edge-triggered, meaning that there is no need to hold the interrupt bit high until the event has been completed. Each bit in the ILAT register (except for the user interrupt at bit 9) is tied to a specific hardware event. The ILAT register can be accessed directly or through the address aliases ILATST and ILATCL.

## ILATST (0xF042C)

An alias for the ILAT register that allows bits within the ILAT register to be set individually. Writing a “1” to an individual bit of the ILATST register will set the corresponding ILAT bit to “1”. Writing a “0” to an individual bit will have no effect on the ILAT register. The ILATST alias cannot be read.

## ILATCL (0xF0430)

An alias for the ILAT register that allows bits within the ILAT register to be cleared individually. Writing a “1” to an individual bit of the ILATCL register will clear the corresponding ILAT bit to “0”. Writing a “0” to an individual bit will have no effect on the ILAT register. The ILATST alias cannot be read.

## IMASK (0xF0424)

This is a masking register for blocking interrupts on a per-interrupt basis. All interrupts are latched by the ILAT register but can be blocked from reaching the program sequencer by setting the appropriate bit in the IMASK register. At each bit position, a “1” means the interrupt is masked.

## IRET (0xF0420)

When an interrupt is serviced, the program counter of the upcoming sequential instruction is saved in the IRET register. The value in the IRET register is used by the RTI instruction to return to the original thread at a later time. For nested interrupt service routines, the IRET should be saved on the stack.

## IPEND (0xF0434)

This is a status register that keeps track of the interrupt service routines currently being processed. A bit is set when the interrupt enters the core and redirects the program flow and is cleared by the software executing an RTI instruction. The lowest numbered bit set to “1” indicates the currently serviced interrupt. Only interrupts in the ILAT register with a number less than the lowest bit in the IPEND register reach the program sequencer. This register can be used to implement nested interrupts. The register should never be directly written by a program.

##  STATUS (0xF0404)

The register reflects the state of the processor and should always be saved on entering an interrupt service routine. The STATUS register can be written using the MOVTS instruction or by directly writing to the register from an external host. The sticky flags can only be cleared through the MOVTS instruction or an externally generated write transaction. Status bits [2:0] are ready only bits controlled by the operational state of the CPU, but can be written forcibly through the FSTATUS alias.
